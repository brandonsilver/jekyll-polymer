The website is back online!

<!--more-->

After a brief hiatus the cause of which I am too embarrassed to speak of, brandonsilver.com is back up and running. On a completely unrelated note, I would highly recommend NOT allowing your domains to expire in order to re-register in the hopes of doing so more cheaply than an actual transfer. When they expire, they automatically fall into a 30-day limbo of sorts where no one can re-register them save for the original registrant (and a lot of good that does if you've canceled your account with said registrant). Basically, find a good domain host **and stick with it**. 

Any who, what have I been up to these past months sans-website? I've been pretty busy, actually, what with graduating high school and all. Hopefully I'll stay busy through the summer and not go stir-crazy with boredom at home.
