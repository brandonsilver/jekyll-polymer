This summer started out uneventful enough. For most of June I didn't do
very much. Sure, I did tidy up the yard a bit, but not a whole lot besides that.

### Volunteer Work

However, toward the end of June I started volunteering at the [Hope Center of Edmond](http://www.hopecenterofedmond.com),
specifically in their food pantry. The folks over at the HOPE Center are a
pleasure to work with, and I feel like I am making a positive contribution
to our community. Overall I am very grateful for the experience
that the HOPE Center has provided me with. 

### Actual Employment

I have also been working as a waiter at [Al's Cafe and Grill](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=3401404715024300847&q=Al's+Cafe+and+Grill,+Edmond,+OK&hl=en&ved=0CBAQ-gswAA&sa=X&ei=oOYfTuDOFZCUzATw942UBA&sig2=KN3QWgRGOPPQ1VY8mO0fEw) for the past two and a half
weeks. It's a small, old-fashioned onion burger joint that also has some delicious daily specials. 
The work is hard (and at times, messy too) but I love to work there. Everyday I learn something new
and interesting about the restaurant business.

### More Employment

And if all of that wasn't enough, I'm also doing contractual work for [Stamm Web Creations](http://www.stammwebcreations.com/).
I'm mostly building and managing WordPress-based websites, but I do other tech-related jobs
for them as well. 

So, that's what I've been up to so far this summer. When school is close to starting I'll post a summer-in-review post too.
