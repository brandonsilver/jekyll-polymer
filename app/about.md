I am a software developer, photography nerd, and do-it-yourself I.T. enthusiast.
I enjoy breaking out of the code factory to appreciate the great outdoors
(especially U.S. National Parks).

My current line of employment centers on web development and systems engineering
for a certain enterprise software product. The stack I work on is heavily Java-based
on the backend, and Bootstrap- and Polymer-based on the frontend.
