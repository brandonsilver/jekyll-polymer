I've just finished making a seperate website for my school notes. You can find it at [notes.brandonsilver.com](http://notes.brandonsilver.com/).

I started it mostly because I already took my Computer Science II notes in markdown, and I wanted a more
readable medium for those notes than just vim. Plus, others in my class might be interested as well, so I went ahead
and started a new [jekyll-based](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki) site for those notes, complete with fancy [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) syntax highlighting for the
multitude of Java code fragments.
